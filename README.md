# Beauty from Ashes - Christian Sexual Trauma Recovery App

> "To grant to those who mourn in Zion, giving them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of the spirit of heaviness." - Isaiah 61:3

## Biblical Foundation

Beauty from Ashes is built on the profound truth of Isaiah 61:3, where God promises to bring beauty from our deepest ashes. This app recognizes that sexual trauma creates some of the most devastating wounds a person can experience, yet holds firmly to the biblical truth that no trauma is beyond God's healing power. We believe that survivors are not defined by what happened to them, but by who God says they are - beloved, precious, and worthy of healing.

**Core Scripture:** Isaiah 61:1-3 - God has sent His Spirit to bind up the brokenhearted and proclaim freedom for the captives, bringing beauty from the ashes of our worst experiences.

## Project Overview

Beauty from Ashes is a comprehensive, trauma-informed mobile web application designed specifically for Christian survivors of sexual assault and abuse. The app integrates evidence-based trauma recovery principles with biblical healing, providing a safe space for survivors to process their experiences, develop coping skills, track their healing journey, and find hope in God's redemptive love.
